Restful-booker API is an API playground created by Mark Winteringham for those wanting to learn more about API testing and tools.

This project is my attempt to learn API test automation using Java and REST Assured.

Languages and Frameworks
The project uses the following:

Java 11 as the programming language.

REST Assured as the REST API test automation framework.

Lombok to generate getters, setters and builders.

JUnit 5 as the testing framework.

Hamcrest as the matcher library.

Datafaker as the fake data generation library.

Maven as the Java build tool.

IntelliJ IDEA as the IDE.
