# Restful-booker API Playground

Welcome to the Restful-booker API Playground! This project is designed to help you learn API test automation using Java and REST Assured.

## Languages and Frameworks

The project is built using the following technologies:

- **Java 11**: Java is used as the primary programming language to write the API test automation code.
- **REST Assured**: REST Assured is employed as the REST API test automation framework, providing a rich set of features to interact with APIs.
- **Lombok**: Lombok is utilized to automatically generate getters, setters, and builders, reducing boilerplate code in Java classes.
- **TestNG**: TestNG serves as the testing framework, enabling the creation and execution of test cases.
- **Hamcrest**: Hamcrest is used as the matcher library to perform assertions in a more readable and expressive manner.
- **Datafaker**: Datafaker is the library used to generate fake data, facilitating data-driven testing scenarios.
- **Maven**: Maven is the chosen Java build tool to handle project dependencies, build processes, and project management.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: IntelliJ IDEA is the integrated development environment used for writing, debugging, and testing the API automation code.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Restful-booker API Playground and run the API tests on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later installed on your system.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:


3. **Import the Project**: Open IntelliJ IDEA (or your preferred IDE) and import the project as a Maven project.

4. **Install Dependencies**: Maven will automatically download and install the required dependencies specified in the `pom.xml` file.

5. **Run the Tests**: Open the test classes located in the `src/test/java` directory, right-click, and select "Run" to execute the API tests.

6. **View Test Reports**: After running the tests, you can view the test reports and results generated by Testng.
